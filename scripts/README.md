You're in the `scripts` subfolder, mostly containing tooling to generate data for the main body of the work in `../project`.

- `data/` contains a script to generate all benchmark data at once with one command
- `utils/` contains little scripts to generate stuff like the table in section 2.3

A reasonably recent release of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required (known to work with v16.2.0) for all scripts.
